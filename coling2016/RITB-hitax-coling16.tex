\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we empirically evaluate classification of product listings into product taxonomies in an e-commerce setting.
The challenges in this task arise from fat to deep taxonomy sub-trees, high imbalance of listings residing in the leaf nodes of the branches; to the presence of noise at various levels depending upon data provenance.
We evaluate several classifiers on two different in-house product listing datasets from a major worldwide e-commerce organization -- 
one with minimal amount of noise and a taxonomy with a better balance of branches to listings at the leaf nodes and the other with a high level of noise and highly imbalanced number of listings in the leaf nodes of the taxonomy subtrees. 
We also evaluate the classifiers on an open source dataset which has been obtained by crawling Amazon with an available \textit{navigational taxonomy}. 
Our experiments show that both gradient boosted trees (GBTs) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with pretrained word embeddings yield the highest gains in error reduction on the in-house datasets while sparse linear classifiers and CNN outperforming GBTs on the Amazon dataset.
